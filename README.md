# Minimal Message Board

This software is a Message Board System written in Java
using Spring Boot and JPA running against and in memory
H2 relational database.  It exposes the message board
functionality via a JSON API.

Things to do include:

- Java Doc.
- Usage (API) Documentation.
- Support for paged data fetches.
- Negative tests of the API.

The GUI included with this software exists for development
purposes, and only exposes a view of the data.  To modify
the data the built-in Swagger-UI may be used.
